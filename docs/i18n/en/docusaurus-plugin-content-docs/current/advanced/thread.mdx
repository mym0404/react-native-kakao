# Threading

## Threads Used by the API

All APIs explicitly operate on the **Main Thread**.

In practice, functions from the Kakao Native SDK operate using a callback mechanism, and the callbacks themselves run on the Main Thread.

While most logic is executed on the Main Thread to prevent any potential errors, the functions provided in this package are primarily utility functions ported from the Native SDK and do not perform heavy computations.

If there is a need for performance improvements in the future, the implementation can be revised accordingly.

:::tip
The `requireMainQueueSetup` in iOS Native Modules can increase app startup time; therefore, it is not used as it is unnecessary.
